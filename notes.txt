Middleware is basically functionality that we want to run between 2 blocks
example: if a user hits the url /insta and the response that we are giving him is
hi hello
so between that we want to check if the user is logged in or is he an admin so we will put middlewares
(functions) in between that check those requirements and then send the response to save our resources

(err,req,res,next) this is how we used to write the parameters, the first one is err, the second is 
the req that was recieved and the third one is the res the thing that we want to send
the last bit is a next flag which is used between middlewares they pass this flag on to denote that
their work is done
