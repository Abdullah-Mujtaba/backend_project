Middleware is basically functionality that we want to run between 2 blocks
example: if a user hits the url /insta and the response that we are giving him is
hi hello
so between that we want to check if the user is logged in or is he an admin so we will put middlewares
(functions) in between that check those requirements and then send the response to save our resources

(err,req,res,next) this is how we used to write the parameters, the first one is err, the second is 
the req that was recieved and the third one is the res the thing that we want to send
the last bit is a next flag which is used between middlewares they pass this flag on to denote that
their work is done 

Middlewares are mostly used in routes (jaate hoye mujh se milke jaana)


****************************
Brcypt library helps to hash the passwords so they are not visible as simple strings
Bcrypt hashes passwords so they are stored as irreversible hashes in the database.
ðŸ‘‰ Even if someone gets access to the DB, they cannot recover the original password.
ðŸ‘‰ The server can still verify passwords by hashing the entered password and comparing it.

âœ… In short: hashes passwords for secure storage.

***********************************
jsonwebtoken tokenizes our data so that it is not freely visible it uses cryptography to do that
JWT is not mainly about hiding data â€” it is about securely transmitting and verifying data.

ðŸ‘‰ JWT does not encrypt the data (unless you use JWT with encryption â€” which is less common).

ðŸ‘‰ JWT is signed â†’ the signature proves that the token has not been tampered with.

ðŸ‘‰ Anyone who gets the token can read the payload (unless you separately encrypt it).

ðŸ‘‰ But the payload cannot be modified because the server will detect an invalid signature.
jsonwebtoken is used to create signed tokens that securely transmit information between client and server.
The token's payload is readable but cannot be modified without invalidating the signature.
It is mainly used for authentication â€” to verify that requests are coming from an authorized user.

jwt is a bearer token, whoever has the token is sent the data

******************
using cloudinary to upload files and multer
multer is how the user uploads the files cloudinary is just there to save the file
get file from multer save it temporary and then save it on cloudinary
we do that because we want to have a reupload chance



************************req.files******************************
[Object: null prototype] {
  avatar: [
    {
      fieldname: 'avatar',
      originalname: 'download.png',
      encoding: '7bit',
      mimetype: 'image/png',
      destination: './public/temp',
      filename: 'download.png',
      path: 'public\\temp\\download.png',
      size: 3372
    }
  ]
}
this is the output of req.files now if the coverImage does not exist then this line 
const coverImageLocalPath= req.files?.coverImage[0]?.path
this wont work because yes req.files does exist but coverImage does not exist so it becomes undefined and we get an error



*********COOKIES***********
*********COOKIES***************
Summary of Cookies:
What are Cookies: Small pieces of data stored in the browser that are sent between the client and server.

Role:
Authentication: Used to store tokens (e.g., JWT) or session IDs.
Session Management: Cookies help maintain the userâ€™s session on the server.
Stateful: Cookies can store user preferences and other state-related data.
Security: Important to use flags like HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite for protecting cookies from XSS, CSRF, and other attacks.




****************LINE 137 user.controller.js***************88
//this was returning an array of objects so that is why we were facing the issue that 
//isPasswordCorrect is not a function had to use the first object of that array which was the schema type which can access the methods
an array was being returned because of me using .find and not using .findOne which would have returned the first object that is why
we were getting an error
Security: Important to use flags like HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite for protecting cookies from XSS, CSRF, and other attacks.



*******************FORM-DATA-NOTE-POSTMAN*************************
the reason we got this error was Cannot destructure property 'username' of 'req.body' as it is undefined.
this was happening becuase we were sending form data which we did not use in login we plainly sent json data
to enable form data we have to use multer a middleware which helps in that
